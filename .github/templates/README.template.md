## Getting Started

Download the latest binary from the Release page.
Make it executable with `chmod +x goplater` and run it for the first time.

Use the `goplater template` command to template files:

```bash
./goplater template TEMPLATE.md -o README.md
```

This will create a new file called `README.md` in your current working directory.

## Usage

### Format

Goplater uses Go's [builtin templating library](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) therefor the syntax should be consistent with other projects.

**Example:**

```
File Content: +​{​{​{ read "./myfile.txt" }​}​}
```

+{{- import "commands" "./commands.gplt" -}}

+{{- call "commands.renderCommandDocs" -}}
